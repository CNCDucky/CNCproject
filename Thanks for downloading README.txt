Welcome to the folder!

You have now taken the first step in making a sturdy and reliable CNC router
by downloading this folder. All .stl files for 3D printing parts of the machine
and recommended firmware is included for free!

However, this project is not free. In the Buying List you will find a list of parts
and tools that are needed to complete the project. This project will also require patience,
dedication and many hours of waiting to complete. If this isn't any of your strong sides,
see this project as an opportunity to learn these things, and much more!

As of the beginning of 2021, there are no instructions or guides to assemble this machine,
but Instructions for 3D printing is available in each subfolder in the "Printed parts" folder.
Go through the Buying List and see which tools or items you already own. When you feel comforable
enough, buy the linked items or source your own components.

Feel free to make your own additions to this machine, share your creations and
contribute to development of this completely open source project.
